# Alpha-Church by Daniel Saunders

This theme is based on [Alpha by HTML5 UP](http://html5up.net/alpha) [@ajlkn](http://twitter.com/ajlkn). Free for personal and commercial use under the CCA 3.0 license (html5up.net/license)

A clean, super minimal responsive template geared towards churches though it could be adapted for other community groups. This theme includes a landing page, open street maps, blog posts and a sermon podcast.
